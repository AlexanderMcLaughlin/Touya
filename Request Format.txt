Make it so that requests are made to the API a random amount of time between 2 seconds and 4 seconds to throw off anything that might be suspicious

Steps:
Create a python file that will parse the anime title XML file for all anime tag "aid" members under animetitles and then call another python script
-make sure to add randomized delay between iterations of the for loop
That python script will take in the aid or "anime ID" as a command line argument and it will issue an HTTP request to the anidb database and call a script
It will then send the output xml to another script for parsing and storing in the database (this will be tricky from a local computer, it will likely be much easier to do on the actual instance)
Create the table that will be holding the data before proceeding
Put the scripts on the ec2 instance for testing and working with the mysql database
Create a bash script that will always run in the background of the instance and once every 3 months do the following
-get the anime title xml file
-store it in the same location as it was before
-call the main python script
-let it run in the background and populate
